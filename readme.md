### How to use it?

- If you didn't do it yet, install the python requests module using the pip install requests console command.

- After starting the WinterfestPresentOpener.py for the first time or after you delete the auth.json file, an Epic Games website will open. From there, login if you are not already logged into your Epic account.

- Then a page should open with content similar to this:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a07bdee4-df08-4f5d-8e3b-3f1f7b98459c" alt="Tutorial" width="400" />

- Click on Confirm.

- If all went well, the program will say it has generated the auth.json file successfully.

- Now the program will open all available Winterfest presents.
